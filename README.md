# Spring Boot 3.0 Security with JWT Implementation
This project demonstrates the implementation of security using Spring Boot 3.0 and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 
In this Spring Boot project, I developed a robust user authentication system with the integration of Spring Security and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The primary goal was to create a secure and efficient mechanism for user login and authentication in a web application.
This project showcases the implementation of a critical security feature—user authentication—in modern web applications. It demonstrates the use of industry-standard tools and best practices for ensuring data privacy and system security. Furthermore, the integration of JWT simplifies session management, making the application more efficient and scalable
